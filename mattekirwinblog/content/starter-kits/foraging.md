## getting inspired and learning

### Videos:

* Black Forager on TikTok and instagram is a great starting point. 
    * she’s incredibly informative, inspiring, and funny


### Books, general foraging

* [Northeast Foraging](https://www.amazon.com/Northeast-Foraging-Flavorful-Wineberries-Regional/dp/1604694173), if you live in the northeast of the US this book is the perfect starter book. you can read over what’s available in your area and then start looking for it. 
    * this was my first foraging book and i ate tons of stuff around boston using this book
* there are books from the same series for other regions, e.g. midwest foraging. 


### Books, mushrooms

* [Mushrooming without Fear](https://www.amazon.com/Mushrooming-without-Fear-Beginners-Collecting/dp/1602391602)
    * extreme beginner book, makes sure every shroom is from a completely non toxic family. so it’s impossible to get poisonous mushrooms if you’re following everything in the book 
* [Mushrooming with Confidence](https://www.amazon.com/Mushrooming-Confidence-Collecting-Edible-Mushrooms/dp/1620871955) 
    * book by the same author. i think of this as the intermediate book that you’d read after mushrooming without fear. 


## identification

{{< foraging-tip >}}
**Golden Rule**: Always have 3 forms of positive ID before eating anything!
{{< /foraging-tip >}}

* always have 3 forms of positive ID. 
* even then, taste test. only eat a little (tbh see if you have a bad digestive reaction). **look up if it needs to be cooked first.**

{{< cute-box title="Safety First!" icon="⚠️" >}}
Even with proper identification, start with small amounts to test for allergic reactions. Some edible plants require cooking to be safe!

### the three forms of identification i use

* foraging books
* [Seek app](https://www.inaturalist.org/pages/seek_app) by iNaturalist or [Google Lens](https://lens.google/#cta-section), these are helpful but not 100% reliable. ALWAYS check another form of ID. 
* facebook foraging groups, local to you (literally search on FB: `foraging <location>` or `foraging and identification <location>`
    * For Massachusetts people: 
        * [Foraging Southern New England](https://www.facebook.com/groups/690403547760993)
        * [Foraging with Friends RI/MA/CT](https://www.facebook.com/groups/477464813304162)
        * [The New England Mushroom Identification Forum](https://www.facebook.com/groups/330632460416930)
* google “green leaves with white undersides massachusetts”
* google whatever you think you have found thru apps or books and TRIPLE CHECK ALL IDENTIFYING CHARACTERISTICS ARE THE SAME 

**if you’re unsure at all DO NOT EAT**
